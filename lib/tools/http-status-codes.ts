Check your token with the <a href="/tools/jwt-expiry-checker">expiry checker</a> before assuming a permissions problem.</li>
        <li><strong>400 vs 422.</strong> 400 means the server could not even parse what you sent, usually broken JSON. 422 means it parsed fine but a value was unacceptable — a missing field or a bad email. If you get 400, run the body through the <a href="/tools/json-validator">JSON validator</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>404 on a URL you know exists.</strong> Often authentication: some APIs return 404 instead of 403 so they do not reveal that a resource exists.</li>
        <li><strong>502 vs 503 vs 504.</strong> All mean "not my code": upstream returned garbage, is down, or was too slow, respectively.</li>
