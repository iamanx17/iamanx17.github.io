      <h2>Use of the site</h2>
      <p>
        The tools are free to use, for anything, including commercial work. There is no account and
        no quota. Do not attempt to disrupt the site for other people.
      </p>

      <h2>No warranty</h2>
      <p>
        The tools are provided as they are, without any warranty. Generated code, decoded tokens and
        conversions may be wrong or incomplete — read the output before you rely on it, and test
        generated code before running it against anything that matters.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent the law allows, no liability is accepted for any loss or damage arising from
        use of the site or of anything it produces.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Tools may change or be removed at any time. Any URL that disappears will be pointed at the
        directory rather than left broken where that is practical.
