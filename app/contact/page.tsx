        <li>
          <strong>A conversion bug.</strong> Send the exact input and which tool you used. A command
          that produces wrong code is the most valuable report there is.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A tool suggestion.</strong> Describe the problem rather than the tool — what were
          you trying to do when you went looking?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Something broken.</strong> Which browser, and what you saw.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please remove real tokens and customer data before sending anything. A redacted example
        reproduces the bug just as well.
